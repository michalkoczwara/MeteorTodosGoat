# Install

I'm not sure if this is the right steps, but here you go.

* Install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) (note, node4 is the offically supported version)
* Install [iron-cli](https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-cli). It is a makes creating projects easier.
* Install mongo

# Run

In the `todosgoat` directory run `iron run`

# Notes

I'm using Less, Jade (Pug), and CoffeeScript...because they are better then the original languages. If you think 
otherwise, you are wrong.

I'm using Iron-Meteor because it makes creating apps really simple. Meteor semi-recently changed their _approved_ 
directory structure. Iron does not (yet) follow this structure, but it really doesn't matter.

# TODOs

* Create levels for exploitation
* Detect/Prevent injection of todo to another user
* Working admin interface
